# BandMeetup
Band Meetup is a web application that allows users to connect with other users who share similar interests in music and musical instruments. It enables users to create accounts as musicians and venue managers. Muscians can have different statuses such as 'looking for jam seesions' or 'Looking for a band to join'. Venue managers can list their events which can be viewed by all users and other mucicians can participate in these events. Bandmeetup also provides the search functionality to search other musician or venue manager profiles.
